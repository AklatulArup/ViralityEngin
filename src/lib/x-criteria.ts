// X (Twitter) Readiness Score (XRS) — 2026 edition
// 20 criteria, 100 points total.
//
// SOURCES (verified weights):
//   • github.com/twitter/the-algorithm-ml (Heavy Ranker weights, April 5 2023 — still canonical reference)
//   • github.com/xai-org/x-algorithm (January 2026 Grok/Phoenix release)
//
// CONFIRMED HEAVY RANKER WEIGHTS (from scored_tweets_model_weight_* config):
//     favourite (like)           :  +0.5
//     retweet                    :  +1.0
//     reply                      : +13.5  (27x a like)
//     reply_engaged_by_author    : +75.0  (150x a like)  ← highest positive weight
//     good_profile_click         : +12.0  (click profile then like or reply)
//     good_click (into convo)    : +11.0
//     good_click_v2 (stay 2+ min):  +10.0
//     video_playback50           :  +0.005
//     negative_feedback_v2       : -74.0  (show less often, mute, block the author)
//     report                     : -369.0
//
// 2026 CHANGES (xai-org/x-algorithm Jan 2026 release):
//  • Grok-based Phoenix transformer replaces legacy Heavy Ranker MaskNet.
//  • All hand-engineered features and heuristics eliminated.
//  • Negative signals carry massive weights (block -3.0 in the summary scoring
//    layer that sits on top of the transformer). Optimises for long-term retention, not rage-bait.
//  • ~1,500 candidates blended 50/50 in-network vs out-of-network per feed refresh.
//  • Author Diversity Penalty: algorithm limits posts from same account per session.
//  • Premium boost: +4 to +16 TweepCred points.
//  • TweepCred threshold: below 0.65, only 3 of your tweets considered for distribution.
//  • 6-hour time decay — post visibility halves every 6 hours.
