    "Sentence 2: the structural reason it is succeeding or failing on THIS platform (not a generic answer). " +
    "Sentence 3: the single highest-leverage change.",

  psychologist:
    "You are an Audience Psychologist who understands that algorithm signals are effects, not causes. " +
    "Write EXACTLY 3 sentences. " +
    "Sentence 1: the dominant emotion this content activates and the specific psychological mechanism driving completion or sharing on this platform. " +
    "Sentence 2: what this audience does AFTER watching (follow, save, DM, comment, nothing) and why — cite the emotion-to-action chain. " +

const PLATFORM_CONTEXT: Record<string, string> = {
  youtube:
    "PLATFORM: YouTube Long-Form. Formula: AVD(50%) + CTR(30%) + Satisfaction(20%). " +
    "Kill threshold: CTR <2% = Browse/Suggested sunset. AVD <30% over 90 days = decay. " +
    "PSYCHOLOGY: Trust is the dominant mechanism. Viewers feel personally betrayed by clickbait (title over-promises, content under-delivers). " +
    "Curiosity + Inspiration sustain AVD. The Zeigarnik effect (open loops stacked every 2-3 min) prevents exit. " +
    "Satisfaction signal = did the viewer feel their time was well spent? Hype button (2026) directly measures this. " +
    "Niche: prop trading → funded trading search → forex education → trading tutorials. " +
    "CTA hierarchy: keep watching (AVD) > Hype button > FundedNext free trial > subscribe for series.",

  youtube_short:
    "PLATFORM: YouTube Shorts. Formula: V_vs(50%) + Loop(30%) + ExtShares(20%). " +
    "Kill threshold: >30% swipe-away Frame 1 = PERMANENT burial. No 48hr cap in 2026. " +
    "PSYCHOLOGY: Frame 1 triggers preattentive processing (0-50ms) — visual pattern interruption before conscious thought. " +
    "Loop rate is driven by hidden information psychology — something wasn't fully processed on first watch. " +
    "External shares (WhatsApp/Discord) are driven by awe or outrage — 'I need to show someone this.' " +
    "The Zeigarnik effect doesn't apply to Shorts — completion is mechanical (keep it short, don't give them time to think). " +
    "Niche: prop trading shorts → finance shorts → money shorts → entrepreneur shorts. " +
    "CTA hierarchy: external share to trading group > loop design > Long-Form bridge > FundedNext free trial.",

  tiktok:
    "PLATFORM: TikTok FYP (2026 — US algorithm now on Oracle/USDS). Primary signals: Completion rate (target 70%+ in 2026, up from 50%), Rewatch/Loop rate (outranks follower count), Share rate (27x a like in weights). " +
    "Qualified View = watched 5+ seconds (Creator Rewards payout metric). Videos over 60s earn higher payout tier. " +
    "Kill: sub-70% completion = 200-view jail. CapCut/IG/YT watermarks = immediate deprioritisation. " +
    "2026 additions: TikTok search is a direct ranking signal (49% of US users treat it as a search engine per Adobe). Spoken words, captions, on-screen text are indexed by the SEO system. Original audio now outperforms trending audio for long-term distribution. " +
    "PSYCHOLOGY: Completion driven by Zeigarnik tension — never resolve before final 5 seconds. Rewatch driven by hidden information — design a detail that only makes sense on second viewing. Shares driven by tribal identity ('this is us') or anxiety ('this could affect you'), not generic shareable content. " +
    "Like = dopamine but NO distribution power. Tell creators: stop optimising for likes. " +
    "Optimal duration: 20-40s (max completion) OR 60-180s (Creator Rewards boost). 45-55s is the dead zone. " +
    "3-beat arc: Hook (0-2s pattern interrupt) → Deliver (3s to end-5s) → Residue (final 3s emotional state). " +
    "CTA: 'Send this to your trading group' > save for reference > substantive comment > FundedNext free trial.",

  instagram:
    "PLATFORM: Instagram Reels (2026 — three confirmed signals per Mosseri). " +
    "CONFIRMED RANKING SIGNALS: (1) Watch time (most important across all surfaces), (2) Sends per reach (DM shares — 3-5x a like, primary growth signal for non-follower reach), (3) Likes per reach (connected reach signal). " +
    "Kill thresholds: 10+ reposts in 30 days = EXCLUDED from Explore/Reels recommendations entirely. Watermarks (TikTok/CapCut/YT) = immediate disqualification. Failed 3-second hold in audition phase = throttled before your own followers see it. " +
    "2026 additions: Reels up to 3 minutes recommended to non-followers. 'Your Algorithm' feature (Dec 2025) lets users add/remove topics. Trial Reels test content with non-followers before exposing to your audience. Originality Score penalises recycled content. Keyword-rich captions beat hashtag stuffing by ~30%. Hashtags: 3-5 specific is enough. " +
    "PSYCHOLOGY: DM sends driven by belonging — 'this is for a specific person I know'. Saves driven by anxiety reduction — 'I'll need this later'. 3-sec hold is purely visual — caption overlay hits at 1.5s so hook MUST be visual or large text. " +
    "Dual-signal holy grail: one CTA that creates both belonging (DM) and reference value (save). " +
    "Optimal duration: 15-30s (max completion) OR 60-180s (long-form Reel push). " +
    "CTA: DM + save dual signal > DM send to named recipient > save for reference > FundedNext free trial.",

  x:

Negative: 'Show less often'/mute/block -74, Report -369. " +
    "Kill thresholds: TweepCred score below 0.65 = only 3 of your tweets considered per cycle. External link in post body = low reach (X keeps users on-platform). 2+ hashtags triggers spam classifier, reduces reach ~40%. 6-hour time decay: post loses 50% visibility every 6 hours. " +
    "2026 additions: Phoenix transformer reads post text + watches videos (100M+ daily per Musk). Hand-engineered features eliminated. Author Diversity Penalty limits posts per account per feed session. Premium boost: +4 to +16 TweepCred points. Community posts now surface to non-members. Grok-powered 'For You' customisation via natural language. " +
    "PSYCHOLOGY: X is the status and opinion engine. Replies are weighted so high (27x a like) because they signal conversation quality and opinion dominance. A reply-chain where the author replies back scores the highest of anything on the platform. " +
    "CTA: reply to EVERY reply in first 30 min (unlock the +75 weight) > put links in first reply never the post > 0-2 hashtags max > 2-3 posts/day (author diversity) > post during first 6-hour window > FundedNext free trial in bio.",

// ── Playbook knowledge injection ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Key principles from the FundedNext playbook injected into every analysis

const PLAYBOOK_CONTEXT = `
PLAYBOOK PRINCIPLES (apply when relevant):
- Hook frameworks: Visual Proof, Counterintuitive, Number, Mistake/Failure, Event-Reactive, Loop/Rewatch, Search/SEO, Identity Mirror, Series/Day-N, Comparison
- Emotional arcs: Short-form = 3 beats (Disruption → Deliver → Residue). Long-form = 6 beats (Disruption → Stakes → Journey → Peak → Resolution → Call)
- The algorithm measures EFFECTS. Psychology creates the CAUSES. Fix the emotion first; the metrics follow.
- Highest-completion archetype across all platforms: Mistake/Failure reveal (vulnerability + 'this could happen to me')
- Highest-share archetype: Proof/Payout reveal (awe + inspiration) AND Market Event reaction (recency × spread)
- Arousal-action chain (Berger & Milkman): emotional stimulus → physiological arousal → urge to act → platform mechanic determines the action form
- FundedNext CTA hierarchy: Free trial (lowest friction) > Buy challenge (post proof only) > Community > Named recipient DM > Save for reference
