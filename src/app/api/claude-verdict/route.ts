    "Sentence 2: the structural reason it is succeeding or failing on THIS platform (not a generic answer). " +

  psychologist:
    "You are an Audience Psychologist who understands that algorithm signals are effects, not causes. " +

    "Sentence 1: the dominant emotion this content activates and the specific psychological mechanism driving completion or sharing on this platform. " +
    "Sentence 2: what this audience does AFTER watching (follow, save, DM, comment, nothing) and why — cite the emotion-to-action chain. " +

    "Sentence 2: the timing verdict — is the creator early, on time, or late to this topic cycle — and what the window looks like. " +

const PLATFORM_CONTEXT: Record<string, string> = {
  youtube:
    "PLATFORM: YouTube Long-Form. Formula: AVD(50%) + CTR(30%) + Satisfaction(20%). " +
    "Kill threshold: CTR <2% = Browse/Suggested sunset. AVD <30% over 90 days = decay. " +
    "PSYCHOLOGY: Trust is the dominant mechanism. Viewers feel personally betrayed by clickbait (title over-promises, content under-delivers). " +
    "Curiosity + Inspiration sustain AVD. The Zeigarnik effect (open loops stacked every 2-3 min) prevents exit. " +
    "Satisfaction signal = did the viewer feel their time was well spent? Hype button (2026) directly measures this. " +
    "Niche: prop trading → funded trading search → forex education → trading tutorials. " +
    "CTA hierarchy: keep watching (AVD) > Hype button > FundedNext free trial > subscribe for series.",

  youtube_short:
    "PLATFORM: YouTube Shorts. Formula: V_vs(50%) + Loop(30%) + ExtShares(20%). " +
    "Kill threshold: >30% swipe-away Frame 1 = PERMANENT burial. No 48hr cap in 2026. " +
    "PSYCHOLOGY: Frame 1 triggers preattentive processing (0-50ms) — visual pattern interruption before conscious thought. " +
    "Loop rate is driven by hidden information psychology — something wasn't fully processed on first watch. " +
    "External shares (WhatsApp/Discord) are driven by awe or outrage — 'I need to show someone this.' " +
    "The Zeigarnik effect doesn't apply to Shorts — completion is mechanical (keep it short, don't give them time to think). " +
    "Niche: prop trading shorts → finance shorts → money shorts → entrepreneur shorts. " +
    "CTA hierarchy: external share to trading group > loop design > Long-Form bridge > FundedNext free trial.",

  tiktok:
    "PLATFORM: TikTok FYP. Formula: Completion(45%) + Rewatch(35%) + DM_send(20%). " +
    "Leaked points: DM=25, Save=15, Finish=8, Comment=8, Like=3. Kill: <70% completion = 200-view jail. " +
    "PSYCHOLOGY: Completion is driven by the Zeigarnik effect — never resolve the tension before the final 5 seconds. " +
    "Rewatch is driven by hidden information — design a detail that only makes sense on second viewing. " +
    "DM sends are driven by tribal identity ('this is us') or anxiety ('this could affect you') — not generic shareable content. " +
    "Like = dopamine but NO distribution power. Tell creators: stop optimising for likes. " +
    "The 3-beat arc for TikTok: Hook (0-2s pattern interrupt) → Deliver (3s-end-5s rapid revelation) → Residue (final 3s emotional state). " +
    "Niche: prop trading → day trading → finance → entrepreneur → making money online. " +
    "CTA: 'Send this to your trading group' > save > substantive comment > FundedNext free trial.",

  instagram:
    "PLATFORM: Instagram Reels. Formula: DM_sends(40%) + Saves(30%) + 3s_hold+Watch(30%). " +
    "Mosseri confirmed DM sends = #1 signal. Saves = 3x like. Kill: <40% 3-sec hold = 5-10x less reach. " +
    "PSYCHOLOGY: DM sends are driven by the belonging signal — 'this is for a specific person in my life.' " +
    "Saves are driven by anxiety reduction — 'I can't memorise this, I'll lose access to it.' Reference utility = saves. " +
    "3-sec hold is purely visual pattern interruption — the caption overlay appears at 1.5s so the hook MUST be visual. " +
    "The dual-signal holy grail: one CTA that creates both belonging (DM) and anxiety reduction (Save) simultaneously. " +
    "Niche: prop trading → personal finance → financial freedom → lifestyle aspirational. " +
    "CTA: DM + save dual signal > DM send to named recipient > save for reference > FundedNext free trial.",

// ── Playbook knowledge injection ─────────────────────────────────────────

const PLAYBOOK_CONTEXT = `
PLAYBOOK PRINCIPLES (apply when relevant):
- Hook frameworks: Visual Proof, Counterintuitive, Number, Mistake/Failure, Event-Reactive, Loop/Rewatch, Search/SEO, Identity Mirror, Series/Day-N, Comparison
- Emotional arcs: Short-form = 3 beats (Disruption → Deliver → Residue). Long-form = 6 beats (Disruption → Stakes → Journey → Peak → Resolution → Call)
- The algorithm measures EFFECTS. Psychology creates the CAUSES. Fix the emotion first; the metrics follow.
- Highest-completion archetype across all platforms: Mistake/Failure reveal (vulnerability + 'this could happen to me')
- Highest-share archetype: Proof/Payout reveal (awe + inspiration) AND Market Event reaction (recency × spread)
- Arousal-action chain (Berger & Milkman): emotional stimulus → physiological arousal → urge to act → platform mechanic determines the action form
- FundedNext CTA hierarchy: Free trial (lowest friction) > Buy challenge (post proof only) > Community > Named recipient DM > Save for reference
